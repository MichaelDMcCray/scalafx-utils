# Sarahâ€™s ScalaFX Utilities #

This project contains helper functions, utilities and convenience
functions for working with JavaFX and ScalaFx in Scala.

ScalaFX does a tremendous job at making JavaFX more usable from Scala,
but it doesn't go as far as it could in facilitating functional and
reactive programming.

This code is offered as is with now guarantees.


## Installation ##

To use ScalaFX, add the following to your SBT build:

    libraryDependencies += "org.gerweck.scala" %% "scalafx-utils" % "0.2.0"
