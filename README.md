# Sarahâ€™s ScalaFX Utilities #

This project contains helper functions, utilities and convenience functions
for working with JavaFX and ScalaFx in Scala.

ScalaFX does a tremendous job at making JavaFX more usable from Scala, but
it doesn't go as far as it could in facilitating functional and reactive
programming. This project is an attempt to add additional facilities that
further bridge the beautiful Scala with JavaFX.

This code is offered as is with now guarantees. You are free to use it if you
find it useful, but this is not part of any production project and it may have
serious bugs. These APIs may also change at any time, and I make no guarantees
that the project will be maintained at all. I welcome any bug reports and I
will be happy to merge high-quality pull requests if you find a bug.

## Installation ##

To use ScalaFX, add the following to your SBT build:

    libraryDependencies += "org.gerweck.scala" %% "scalafx-utils" % "0.7.0"
